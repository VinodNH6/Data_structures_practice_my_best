/*
Solution 1:  [hashmap]
===========
- Traverse the list individually and keep putting the node addresses in a Hash Table. 
- At any point, if NULL is reached then return false 
- If the next of the current nodes points to any of the previously stored nodes in  Hash then return true.

Time complexity: O(N), Only one traversal of the loop is needed.
Auxiliary Space: O(N), N is the space required to store the value in the hashmap.



Solution 2: [change Node structure]
===========
- Have a visited flag with each node.
- Traverse the linked list and keep marking visited nodes.
- If you see a visited node again then there is a loop.

Time complexity: O(N), Only one traversal of the loop is needed.
Auxiliary Space: O(1)



Solution 3: [slow & fast pointers]
==========
- see above.
